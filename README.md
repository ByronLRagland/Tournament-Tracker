# Tournament-Tracker
Tournament Tracker is a Winforms application that allows clients to create and track single elimination tournaments. 
Users create/assign team members, teams, and prizes for a desired tournament then randomized matchups are determined to create the tournament.
The application sends email notifications to teams participating in the tournament and notifies teams of the winner of said tournament.
Collected data can be stored using the MSSQL Server or in the form of a textfile at the user's discretion.
